Top-Down RPG in Unity

This is a solo indie game development project to create a top-down RPG using Unity. The goal is to learn and apply all aspects of game development, including programming, game design, art, and storytelling, while building a functional game from scratch.

The game will feature simple mechanics, a fantasy-inspired setting, and entirely custom-created assets. It serves as a learning experience and a step toward mastering game development.
